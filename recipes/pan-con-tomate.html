    <h3>Description</h3>

     <p>
        During my trip to Barcelona, Spain I was introduced to this delicious and super simple recipe.
        Perfect at any time of the day ðŸ˜‹
     </p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

     <ul>

        <li>2 slices of bread (hearty crusty bread is recommended)</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>
        <li>1 or 2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>

     </ul>

     <ol>

        <li>Prepare the bread. Slice it into thick pieces (if using ciabatta, I recommend 
            slicing each toast around 2-inches wide). If you want to toast it, you can do 
            so in a toaster oven for smaller amounts, or brush with a bit of olive oil and 
            place in a broiler until browned and crisp for larger amounts.</li>

        <li>Use a peeled garlic clove to rub each slice of bread. Use as much or as little as preferred. 
            I recommend 1/2-1 clove per tomato toast.</li>

        <li>Slice your tomato in half and rub/squeeze it over the bread to deposit the pulp (not the skin) 
            directly onto the bread.</li>

        <li>Drizzle the tomato toast with the extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of flaky salt, 
            and then enjoy!</li>
        
     </ol>
